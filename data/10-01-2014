<div class="itemcontent" name="decodeable"><p>Sure, smartphones and tablets get all the press, and deservedly so. But if you place the original mainstream eInk device from 2007, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Kindle#First_generation">Amazon Kindle</a>, side by side with today's model, the evolution of eInk devices is just as striking.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IOY8XWQ?tag=codihorr-20"><img src="http://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2014/12/kindle-2007-vs-kindle-2014.jpg" alt="" title=""></a></p>

<p>Each of these devices has a 6 inch eInk screen. Beyond that they're worlds apart. </p>

<p>They may seem awfully primitive compared to smartphones, but that's part of their charm &ndash; they are <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/geek-transportation-systems/">the scooter</a> to the motorcycle of the smartphone. Nowhere near as versatile, but as a form of basic transportation, radically simpler, radically cheaper, and more durable. There's an object lesson here in stripping things away to get to the core. </p>

<p>eInk devices are also pleasant in a paradoxical way because <strong>they basically suck at everything that isn't reading</strong>. That doesn't sound like something you'd want, except when you notice you spend every fifth page switching back to Twitter or Facebook or Tinder or Snapchat or whatever. eInk devices let you tune out the world and truly immerse yourself in <em>reading</em>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ashersarlin.com/archives/2011/11/post_1.php"><img src="http://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2014/12/internetvsresearch.png" alt="" title=""></a></p>

<p>I believe in the broadest sense, <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/books-bits-vs-atoms/">bits &gt; atoms</a>. Sure, we'll always read on <em>whatever</em> device we happen to hold in our hands that can display words and paragraphs. And the advent of retina class devices sure made reading a heck of a lot more pleasant on tablets and smartphones.</p>

<p>But this idea of ultra-cheap, pervasive eInk reading devices eventually replacing those ultra-cheap, pervasive paperbacks I used to devour as a kid has great appeal to me. I can't let it go. <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/because-reading-is-fundamental-2/">Reading is Fundamental</a>, man!</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2014/12/paperback-vs-eink.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>That's why I'm in this weird place where I will buy, sight unseen, every new Kindle eInk device. I wasn't quite crazy enough to buy the <em>original</em> Kindle (I mean, look at that thing) but I've owned every model since the third generation Kindle was introduced in 2010.</p>

<p>I've also been tracking the Kindle prices to see when they can get them down to $49 or lower. We're not quite there yet &ndash; the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00I15SB16?tag=codihorr-20">basic Kindle eInk reader</a>, which by the way is still pretty darn amazing compared to that original 2007 model pictured above &ndash; is currently on sale for $59. </p>

<p>But this is mostly about their new flagship eInk device, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IOY8XWQ?tag=codihorr-20">Kindle Voyage</a>. Instead of being cheap, it's trying to be upscale. The absolute first thing you need to know is <strong>this is the first 300 PPI (aka "retina") eInk reader from Amazon</strong>. If you're familiar with the smartphone world before and after the iPhone 4, then you should already be lining up to own one of these. </p>

<p>When you experience 300 PPI in eInk, you really feel like you're looking at a high quality printed page rather than an array of RGB pixels. Yeah, it's still grayscale, but it is glorious. Here are some uncompressed <a href="http://goodereader.com/blog/electronic-readers/how-to-take-screenshots-on-the-kindle-paperwhite">screenshots</a> I made from mine at native resolution.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IOY8XWQ?tag=codihorr-20"><img src="http://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2014/12/kindle-voyage-screenshot-2.png" alt="" title=""></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IOY8XWQ?tag=codihorr-20"><img src="http://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2014/12/kindle-voyage-screenshot-3.png" alt="" title=""></a></p>

<p>Note that the real device is eInk, so there's a natural paper-like fuzziness that makes it seem even more high resolution than these raw bitmaps would indicate.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2014/12/einkvsLCD-1.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>I <em>finally</em> have enough resolution to pick a thinner font than fat, sassy old <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/pmn-caecilia/">Caecilia</a>.</p>

<p>The backlight was new to the original Paperwhite, and it definitely had some teething pains. The third time's the charm; they've nailed the backlight aspect for improved overall contrast and night reading. The Voyage also adds an ambient light sensor so it automatically scales the backlight to anything from bright outdoors to a pitch-dark bedroom. It's like automatic night time headlights on a car &ndash; one less manual setting I have to deal with before I sit down and get to my reading. It's nice.</p>

<p>The Voyage also adds page turn buttons back into the mix, via pressure sensing zones on the left and right bezel. I'll admit I had some difficulty adjusting to these buttons, to the point that I wasn't sure I would, but I eventually did &ndash; and now I'm a convert. Not having to move your finger into the visible text on the page to advance, and being able to advance without moving your finger <em>at all</em>, just pushing it down slightly (which provides a little haptic buzz as a reward), does make for a more pleasant and efficient reading experience. But it is kind of subtle and it took me a fair number of page turns to get it down.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KD7ZRJ4?tag=codihorr-20"><img src="http://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2014/12/kindle-voyage-case.jpg" alt="" title=""></a></p>

<p>In my experience eInk devices are a bit more fragile than tablets and smartphones. So you'll want a case for automatic on/off and basic "throw it in my bag however" paperback book level protection. Unfortunately, the official Kindle Voyage case is a disaster. Don't buy it.</p>

<p>Previous Kindle cases were expensive, but they were actually very well designed. The Voyage case is expensive and just plain <em>bad</em>. Whoever came up with the idea of a weirdly foldable, floppy origami top opening case on a thing you expect to work like a typical <em>side-opening book</em> should be fired. I recommend something like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KD7ZRJ4?tag=codihorr-20">this basic $14.99 case</a> which works fine to trigger on/off and opens in the expected way.</p>

<p>It's not all sweetness and light, though. The <a href="http://www.lunascafe.org/2011/04/typography-is-about-reading-and-so-are.html">typography issues that have plagued the Kindle</a> are still present in full force. It doesn't personally bother me that much, but it is reasonable to expect more by now from a big company that ostensibly cares about reading. And has a giant budget with lots of smart people on its payroll.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>This is what text&#10;looks like on&#10;a kindle.</p>&mdash; Justin Van Slembrou… (@jvanslem) <a href="https://twitter.com/jvanslem/status/431488285613891584">February 6, 2014</a></blockquote>  

<script async src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>If you've dabbled in the world of eInk, or you were just waiting for a best of breed device to jump in, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IOY8XWQ?tag=codihorr-20">Kindle Voyage is easy to recommend</a>. It's probably peak mainstream eInk. Would recommend, would buy again, will probably buy all future eInk models because I have an addiction. A reading addiction. Reading is fundamental. Oh, hey, $2.99 Kindle editions of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1451642598?tag=codihorr-20">The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich?</a> Yes, please. </p>

<p>(At the risk of coming across as a total Amazon shill, I'll also mention that the new <a href="http://www.mcelhearn.com/how-to-set-up-kindle-family-library/">Amazon Family Sharing program</a> is amazing and lets me and my wife <em>finally</em> share books made of bits in a sane way, the way we used to share regular books: by throwing them at each other in anger.)</p>

<div class="itemcontent" name="decodeable"><p>Most discussions show a bit of information next to each user:</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2014/11/forum-user-info-1.png" alt=""></p>

<p>What message does this send?</p>

<ul>
<li>The only number you can control printed next to your name is post count.</li>
<li>Everyone who reads this will see your current post count.</li>
<li>The more you post, the bigger that number next to your name gets.</li>
</ul>

<p>If I have learned anything from the Internet, it is this: <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/for-a-bit-of-colored-ribbon/">be very, <em>very</em> careful when you put a number next to someone's name</a>. Because <strong>people will do whatever it takes to make that number go up</strong>.</p>

<p>If you don't think deeply about exactly <em>what</em> you're encouraging, <em>why</em> you're encouraging it, and all the things that may happen as a result of that encouragement, you may end up with … something darker. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071102022046/http://benbrown.com/says/2007/10/29/i-love-my-chicken-wire-mommy">A lot darker</a>.</p>

<p>Printing a post count number next to every user's name implies that the more you post, the better things are. The more you talk, the better the conversations become. Is this the right message to send to everyone in a discussion? More fundamentally, <em>is this even true?</em></p>

<p>I find that the value of conversations has little to do with how much people are talking. I find that too much talking has a <em>negative</em> effect on conversations. Nobody has time to listen to the resulting massive stream of conversation, they end up just waiting for their turn to pile on and talk, too. <strong>The best conversations are with people who spend most of their time listening</strong>. The number of times you've posted in a given topic is not a leaderboard; it's a record of failing to communicate.</p>

<p>Consider the difference between a chat room and a discussion. Chat is a never-ending flow of disconnected, stream of consciousness sentences that you can occasionally dip your toes in to get the temperature of the water, and that's about it. Discussion is the process of lobbing paragraphs back and forth that results in an evolution of positions as your mutual understanding becomes more nuanced. We hope.</p>

<h5 id="thearsbananaexperiment">The Ars Banana Experiment</h5>

<p>Ars Technica ran a little experiment in 2011. When they posted <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2011/04/guns-in-the-home-lots-of-risk-ambiguity/">Guns at home more likely to be used stupidly than in self defense</a>, embedded in the last sentence of the seventh paragraph of the article was this text:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you have read this far, please mention Bananas in your comment below. We're pretty sure 90% of the respondants to this story won't even read it first.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first person to do this is on page 3 of the resulting discussion, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2011/04/guns-in-the-home-lots-of-risk-ambiguity/?comments=1&amp;post=21585045#comment-21585045">comment number 93</a>. Or as helpfully visualized by <a href="http://thoughtcatalog.com/brandon-gorrell/2011/04/the-problem-with-having-a-serious-discussion-on-the-internet/">Brandon Gorrell</a>:</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2014/11/ars-banana-experiment-graphic.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Plenty of talking, but how many people actually read up to paragraph 7 (of 11) of the source article before they rushed to comment on it?</p>

<h5 id="theslateexperiment">The Slate Experiment</h5>

<p>In <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2013/06/how_people_read_online_why_you_won_t_finish_this_article.html">You Won't Finish This Article</a>, Farhad Manjoo dares us to read to the end. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Only a small number of you are reading all the way through articles on the Web. I’ve long suspected this, because so many smart-alecks jump in to the comments to make points that get mentioned later in the piece.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But most of us won't.</p>

<p>He collected a bunch of analytics data based on real usage to prove his point:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2013/06/how_people_read_online_why_you_won_t_finish_this_article.html"><img src="http://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2014/11/article-scroll-graph-slate.png" alt="" title=""></a></p>

<p>These experiments demonstrate that we don't need to incentivize talking. There's far too much talking already. <strong>We badly need to incentivize <em>listening</em></strong>.</p>

<p>And online, listening = reading. That old school program from my childhood was right, so deeply fundamentally right. Reading. <a href="http://readingisfundamental.org/">Reading Is Fundamental</a>.</p>

<p>Let's say you're interested in World War II. Who would you rather have a discussion with about that? The guy who just skimmed the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II">Wikipedia article</a>, or the gal who read the entirety of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1451651686?tag=codihorr-20">The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich</a>?</p>

<p>This emphasis on talking and post count also unnecessarily penalizes lurkers. If you've posted five times in the last 10 years, but you've read every single thing your community has ever written, I can guarantee that you, Mr. or Mrs. Lurker, are a far more important part of that community's culture and social norms than someone who posted 100 times in the last two weeks. Value to a community should be measured every bit by <em>how much you've read</em> as much as how much you talked.</p>

<p><a href="http://readingisfundamental.org/"><img src="http://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2014/11/rif-logo-blue-large.png" alt="" title=""></a></p>

<p>So how do we encourage reading, exactly? </p>

<p>You could do crazy stuff like require commenters to enter some fact from the article, or pass a basic quiz about what the article contained, before allowing them to comment on that article. On some sites, I think this would result in a huge improvement in the quality of the comments. It'd add friction to talking, which <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/training-your-users/">isn't necessarily a bad thing</a>, but it's a negative, indirect way of <em>forcing</em> reading by denying talking. Not ideal.</p>

<p>I have some better ideas.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Remove interruptions to reading, primarily pagination</strong>.</p>

<p>Here's a radical idea: when you get to the bottom of the page, <em>load the next damn page automatically</em>. Isn't that the most natural thing to want when you reach the end of the page, to read the next one? Is there any time that you've ever been on the Internet reading an article, reached the bottom of page 1, and <em>didn't</em> want to continue reading? Pagination is nothing more than <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-end-of-pagination/">an arbitrary barrier to reading</a>, and it needs to die a horrible death.</p>

<p>There are sites that go even further here, such as The Daily Beast, which actually <em>loads the next article</em> when you reach the end of the one you are currently reading. <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/05/27/your-princess-is-in-another-castle-misogyny-entitlement-and-nerds.html">Try it out and see what you think</a>. I don't know that I'd go that far (I like to pick the next thing I read, thanks very much), but it's interesting.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Measure read times and display them</strong>.</p>

<p>What I do not measure, I cannot display as a number next to someone's name, and cannot properly encourage. In Discourse we measure how long each post has been visible in the browser for every (registered) user who encounters that post. Read time is a key metric we use to determine who we trust, and the best posts that people do actually read. If you aren't willing to visit a number of topics and spend time actually <em>listening</em> to us, why should we talk to you &ndash; or trust you.</p>

<p>Forget clicks, forget page loads, measure <em>read time!</em> We've been measuring read times extensively since launch in 2013 and it turns out we're in good company: <a href="https://medium.com/data-lab/mediums-metric-that-matters-total-time-reading-86c4970837d5">Medium</a> and <a href="http://blog.upworthy.com/post/75795679502/what-uniques-and-pageviews-leave-out-and-why-were">Upworthy</a> both recently acknowledged the intrinsic power of this metric.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Give rewards for reading</strong>.</p>

<p>I know, that old saw, gamification, but if you're going to reward someome, do it for the right things and the right reasons. For example, we created a badge for reading to the end of a long 100+ post topic. And our trust levels are based heavily on how often people are returning and how much they are reading, and virtually not at all on how much they post.</p>

<p>To feel live reading rewards in action, try <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/24/technology/all-the-worlds-a-game-and-business-is-a-player.html">this classic New York Times Article</a>. There's even a badge for reading half the article! </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Update in real time</strong>.</p>

<p>Online we tend to read these conversations as they're being written, as people are engaging in live conversations. So if new content arrives, figure out a way to dynamically rez it in <em>without</em> interrupting people's read position. Preserve the back and forth, real time dynamic of an actual conversation. Show votes and kudos and likes as they arrive. If someone edits their post, bring that in too. All of this goes a long way toward making a stuffy old debate feel like a living, evolving thing versus a long distance email correspondence. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>These are strategies I pursued with <a href="http://www.discourse.org/">Discourse</a>, because I believe Reading Is Fundamental. Not just in grade school, but in your life, in my life, in every aspect of online community. To the extent that Discourse can help people learn to be better listeners and better readers &ndash; not just <em>more talkative</em> &ndash; we are succeeding.</p>

<p>If you want to become a true radical, if you want to have deeper insights and better conversations, <strong>spend less time talking and more reading</strong>.</p>

<div class="itemcontent" name="decodeable"><p>Remember how people in the year 2000 used to say how crazy and ridiculous it was, the idea that Anyone Would Ever Run Photoshop in a Web Browser? I mean <em>come on</em>.</p>

<p><a href="http://thenextweb.com/creativity/2014/02/24/9-browser-based-photo-editing-tools/">Oops</a>. </p>

<p>One of my big bets with <a href="http://www.discourse.org/">Discourse</a> is that eventually, <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-pc-is-over/"><em>all</em> computers will be tablets of varying size</a>, with performance basically indistinguishable from a two year old desktop or laptop.</p>

<p>Apps are <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/app-pocalypse-now/">great and all</a>, but there has to be some place for this year's bumper crop of obscene amount of computing superpower to go. I like to use history as my guide, and I believe it's going exactly the same place it did on desktops and laptops &mdash; that no-installing-anything friend of every lazy user on the planet, the inevitable path of least resistance, the <strong>mobile web browser</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/06/cupertinos-photocopiers-what-ios-7-borrowed-from-android/"><img src="http://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2014/11/safarivschromemobile.jpg" alt="" title=""></a></p>

<p>For the last few years, I've been buying every significant tablet device in the run up to the big holiday sales season, and testing them all, to see how many years are left until mobile devices catch up to desktops on general web and JavaScript performance.</p>

<p>How are we doing? Let's benchmark some Discourse client-side <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember</a> JavaScript code:</p>

<table style="width:500px">  
<tr>  
  <td>iPhone 4</td>
  <td>June 2011</td>
  <td>2031ms</td>
</tr>  
<tr>  
  <td>iPhone 5</td>
  <td>Sept 2012</td>
  <td>600ms</td>
</tr>  
<tr>  
  <td>iPhone 5s</td>
  <td>Sept 2013</td>
  <td>300ms</td>
</tr>  
<tr>  
  <td>iPhone 6</td>
  <td>Sept 2014</td>
  <td>250ms</td>
</tr>  
<tr>  
  <td>iPad Air 2</td>
  <td>Oct 2014</td>
  <td>225ms</td>
</tr>  
</table>

<p>My Core i4770k desktop machine scores <strong>180ms</strong> in the same benchmark on the latest version of Chrome x64. I'd say we're solidly within striking distance this year.</p>

<p>I don't like to spend a lot of time talking about news and gadgets here, since the commentary will be irrelevant within a few years. But this year marks a key turning point for mobile and tablet performance, and I've lived with every iteration of these devices for the last couple of years, so I'll make an exception.</p>

<p>Look at this <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/8666/the-apple-ipad-air-2-review/3">performance rampage</a> the <strong>iPad Air 2</strong> goes on:</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2014/11/69018.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Just look at it! <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/8666/the-apple-ipad-air-2-review/3">All the graphs</a> are like this! </p>

<p>It's hard to believe we now live in a world where the Apple "Premium" is no longer about aesthetics, but raw, unbridled, class-leading performance. And you know what? That's something I can totally get behind.</p>

<p>Anyone who tells you the iPad Air 2 is some kind of incremental update must not actually use theirs. As someone who <em>does</em> regularly use his iPad, I can say without hesitation that this is a massively upgraded device. I grew to hate my old iPad Air because of the memory restrictions; I could barely have three tabs open in Mobile Safari without one of them paging out of memory. Thanks x64 and iOS7!</p>

<p>The bonded screen, touchid, the now-adequate-for-x64 2GB of RAM, the amazingly fast triple core CPU, the GPU, and yeah, it's a little thinner. For performance, nothing else even comes close.</p>

<p>It's so fast I sometimes forget I'm not using my <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/products/surface-pro-3">Surface Pro 3</a> with its 4GB RAM and Core i5 CPU. I get hassled when I bring my Surface to meetings, but I patiently explain that it's a very nice third gen hardware design with a fully integrated keyboard cover, IE11 is a great touch browser, and that I'm mostly using the device as a tablet, as a sneak preview of what iPad 8 performance will look like. Based on today's benchmarks with the iPad Air 2 &ndash; chronologically, the iPad "6" &ndash; I believe that's about right.</p>

<p>I also purchased a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Google-Nexus-Tablet-8-9-Inch-Black/dp/B00M6UC5B4?tag=codihorr-20"><strong>Nexus 9</strong></a>. It's the first device to ship with Android 5 and the vaunted Nvidia Tegra K1.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/(http://www.amazon.com/Google-Nexus-Tablet-8-9-Inch-Black/dp/B00M6UC5B4?tag=codihorr-20)"><img src="http://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2014/11/nexus-9-1.jpg" alt="" title=""></a></p>

<p>I'm <em>very</em> impressed with Android 5.0; aesthetically I think it's superior to iOS 8 in a lot of ways, and it is a clear step forward over Android 4. Anyone on older Android devices should definitely upgrade to Android 5 at their first opportunity.</p>

<p>Performance-wise, it is what I've come to expect from Android: <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/8670/google-nexus-9-preliminary-findings/2">erratic</a>. In our Discourse benchmarks, and the latest version of Chrome Android beta, it scores about 750ms, putting it somewhere between the 2011 iPhone 4s and the 2012 iPhone 5. That said, this is the fastest Android device I have ever laid hands on. I just wish it was consistently faster. A lot faster.</p>

<p>To that end, I'd like to ask for your help. We've identified some <a href="https://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=2935">deep bugs in the Android Chrome V8 engine</a> that cause fairly severe performance issues with JavaScript frameworks like Angular and Ember. (Desktop Chrome performance remains class leading; this is highly specific to the Android version of Chrome.) If you know anyone at Google, please ping them about this and see if it can be escalated. I'd love it if more Android users &ndash; including me &ndash; could have a better browser experience when using large JavaScript apps.</p>

<p>I hope over the next year the remaining Android 5 performance bumps can be ironed out. I still like the Nexus 9; if you're a big fan of Google services like GMail, Docs, and Maps like I am, I definitely recommend it. The one I have will be a gift to my mom.</p>

<span>Posted:</span>Thu, 23 Oct 2014 18:43:25 GMT</h5>
<div class="itemcontent" name="decodeable"><p>One of my favorite insights on the subject of online community is from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Chick">Tom Chick</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here is something I've never articulated because I thought, perhaps naively, it was understood:</p>
  
  <p>The priority for participating on this forum is not the quality of the content. I ultimately don't care how smart or funny or observant you are. Those are plusses, but they're never prerequisites. <em>The priority is on how you treat each other.</em> I expect spats, arguments, occasional insults, and even inevitable grudges. We've all done that. But in the end, I expect you to act like a group of friends who care about each other, no matter how dumb some of us might be, no matter what political opinions some of us hold, no matter what games some of us like or dislike. This community is small enough, intimate enough, that I feel it's a reasonable expectation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed, disagreement and arguments are inevitable and even healthy parts of any community. The difference between a sane community and a terrifying warzone is the <em>degree</em> to which disagreement is pursued in the community, gated by <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/02/23/in-favor-of-niceness-community-and-civilization/">the level of respect community members have for each other</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In other words, if a fight is important to you, fight nasty. If that means lying, lie. If that means insults, insult. If that means silencing people, silence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I may be a fan of the <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/in-defense-of-the-smackdown-learning-model/">smackdown learning model</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayfabe">kayfabe</a>, but I am definitely <em>not</em> a fan of fighting nasty.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>I expect you to act like a group of friends who care about each other</strong>, no matter how dumb some of us might be, no matter what political opinions some of us hold, no matter what games some of us like or dislike.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's a word for this: <em>empathy</em>.</p>

<p>One of the first things I learned when I began researching discussion platforms two years ago is the importance of <strong>empathy as the fundamental basis of all stable long term communities</strong>. The goal of discussion software shouldn't be to teach you how to click the reply button, and how to make bold text, but how to engage in civilized online discussion with other human beings without that discussion inevitably breaking down into the collective howling of wolves.</p>

<p>That's what the discussion software should be teaching you:  <em>Empathy.</em></p>

<p>You. Me. Us. We can all <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-just-in-time-theory/">occasionally use a gentle reminder</a> that there is a real human being on the other side of our screen, a person <a href="http://sivers.org/real">remarkably like us</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://xkcd.com/438/"><img src="http://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2014/10/internet_argument.png" alt="" title=""></a></p>

<p>I've been immersed in the world of social discussion for two years now, and I keep going back to the well of empathy, time and time again. The first thing we did was start with a <a href="http://blog.discourse.org/2013/03/the-universal-rules-of-civilized-discourse/">solid set of community guidelines</a> on civilized discussion, and I'm proud to say that we ship and prominently feature those guidelines with every copy of Discourse. They are bedrock. But these guidelines only work to the extent that they are understood, and the community helps enforce them.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/your-community-door/">Your Community Door</a>, I described the danger of allowing cruel and hateful behavior in your community &ndash; behavior so obviously corrosive that it should never be tolerated in any quantity. If your community isn't capable of regularly exorcising the most toxic content, and the people responsible for that kind of content, it's in trouble. Those rare bad apples are <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-bad-apple-group-poison/">group poison</a>.</p>

<p>Hate is easy to recognize. Cruelty is easy to recognize. You <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/your-community-door/">do not tolerate these in your community</a>, full stop.</p>

<p>But what about behavior that isn't so obviously corrosive? What about behavior patterns that seem sort of vaguely negative, but &hellip; nobody can show you exactly how this behavior is directly hurting anyone? What am I talking about? Take a look at the <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/which-online-discussion-archetype-are-you/">Flamewarriors Online Discussion Archetypes</a>, a bunch of discussion behaviors that never <em>quite</em> run afoul of the rules, per se, but result in discussions that degenerate, go in circles, or make people not want to be around them.</p>

<p>What we're getting into is shades of grey, the really difficult part of community moderation. I've been working on Discourse long enough to identify some subtle dark patterns of community discussion that &ndash; while nowhere near as dangerous as hate and cruelty &ndash; are still <strong>harmful enough to the overall empathy level of a community</strong> that they should be actively recognized when they emerge, and interventions staged.</p>

<h3 id="1endlesscontrarianism">1. Endless Contrarianism</h3>

<p><a href="http://forlackofabettercomic.com/?id=173"><img src="http://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2014/10/internet-contrarian.png" alt="" title=""></a></p>

<p>Disagreement is fine, even expected, provided people can disagree in an agreeable way. But when someone <strong>joins your community for the <em>sole purpose</em> of disagreeing</strong>, that's Endless Contrarianism.</p>

<p>Example: As an athiest, Edward shows up on a religion discussion area to educate everyone there about the futility of religion. Is that really the purpose of the community? Does anyone in the community expect to defend the very concept of religion while participating there? </p>

<p>If all a community member can seem to contribute is endlessly pointing out how wrong everyone else is, and how everything about this community is headed in the wrong direction &ndash; that's not building  constructive discussion &ndash; or the community. Edward is just arguing for the sake of argument. <a href="http://www.systemcomic.com/2011/08/03/so-youre-mad-about-something-on-the-internet/">Take it to debate school</a>.</p>

<h3 id="2axegrinding">2. Axe-Grinding</h3>

<p><img src="http://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2014/10/stock-footage-grinding-the-axe.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Part of what makes discussion fun is that it's flexible; a variety of topics will be discussed, and those discussions may naturally meander a bit within the context defined by the site and whatever categories of discussion are allowed there. Axe-Grinding is when a user <strong>keeps constantly gravitating back to the same pet issue or theme for weeks or months on end</strong>.</p>

<p>Example: Sara finds any opportunity to trigger up a GMO debate, no matter what the actual topic is. Viewing Sara's post history, GMO and Monsanto are constant, repeated themes in any context. Sara's negative review of a movie will mention eating GMO popcorn, because it's not really about the movie &ndash; it's always about her pet issue.</p>

<p>This kind of inflexible, overbearing single-issue focus tends to drag discussion into strange, unwanted directions, and rapidly becomes tiresome to other participants who have probably heard everything this person has to say on that topic multiple times already. Either Sara needs to let that topic go, or she needs to find a dedicated place (e.g. GMO discussion areas) where others want to discuss it as much as she does, and take it there.</p>

<h3 id="3griefing">3. Griefing</h3>

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/84E7zzTqNtE" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>In discussion, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griefer">griefing</a> is when someone <strong>goes out of their way to bait a particular person for weeks or months on end</strong>. By that I mean they pointedly follow them around, choosing to engage on whatever topic that person appears in, and needle the other person in any way they can, but always strictly by the book and not in violation of any rules&hellip; technically.</p>

<p>Example: Whenever Joe sees George in a discussion topic, Joe now pops in to represent the opposing position, or point out flaws in George's reasoning. Joe also takes any opportunity to remind people of previous mistakes George made, or times when George was rude.</p>

<p>When the discussion becomes more about the person than the topic, you're in deep trouble. It's not supposed to be about the participants, but <em>the topic at hand</em>. When griefing occurs, the discussion becomes a stage for personal conflict rather than a way to honestly explore topics and have an entertaining discussion. Ideally the root of the conflict between Joe and George can be addressed and resolved, or Joe can be encouraged to move on and leave the conflict behind. Otherwise, one of these users needs to find another place to go. </p>

<h3 id="4persistentnegativity">4. Persistent Negativity</h3>

<iframe width="512" height="288" src="http://www.hulu.com/embed.html?eid=ots_hph5c6luhcfwyxv9aw" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>Nobody expects discussions to be all sweetness and light, but neverending vitriol and negativity are giant wet blankets. It's hard to enjoy anything when someone's constantly reminding you how terrible the world is. Persistent negativity is <strong>when someone's negative contributions to the discussion far outweigh their positive contributions.</strong></p>

<p>Example: Even long after the game shipped, Fred mentions that the game took far too long to ship, and that it shipped with bugs. He paid a lot of money for this game, and feels he didn't get the enjoyment from the game that was promised for the price. He warns people away from buying expansions because this game has a bad track record and will probably fail. Nobody will be playing it online soon because of all the problems, so why bother even trying? Wherever topics happen to go, Fred is there to tell everyone this game is worse than they knew.</p>

<p>If Fred doesn't have anything positive to contribute, what exactly is the purpose of his participation in that community? What does he hope to achieve? Criticism is welcome, but that shouldn't be the sum total of everything Fred contributes, and he should be reasonably constructive in his criticism. People join communities to build things and celebrate the enjoyment of those things, not have other people dump all over it and constantly describe how much they suck and disappoint them. If there isn't any silver lining in Fred's cloud, and he can't be encouraged to find one, he should be asked to find other places to haunt.</p>

<h3 id="5ranting">5. Ranting</h3>

<p><img src="http://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2014/10/scream-computer.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Discussions are social, and thus emotional. You <em>should</em> feel something. But <strong>prolonged, extreme appeal to emotion</strong> is fatiguing and incites arguments. Nobody wants to join a dry, technical session at the Harvard Debate Club, because that'd be boring, but there is a big difference between a persuasive post and a straight-up rant.</p>

<p>Example: Holly posts at the extremes &ndash; either something is the worst thing that ever happened, or the best thing that ever happened. She will post 6 to 10 times in a topic and state her position as forcefully as possible, for as long and as loud as it takes, to as many individual people in the discussion as it takes, to get her point across. The stronger the language in the post, the better she likes it.</p>

<p>If Holly can't make her point in a reasonable way in one post and a followup, perhaps she should rethink her approach. Yelling at people, turning the volume to 11, and describing the situation in the most emotional, extreme terms possible to elicit a response &ndash; unless this really <em>is</em> the worst or best thing to happen in years &ndash; is a bit like yelling fire in a crowded theater. It's irresponsible. Either tone it down, or take it somewhere that everyone talks that way.</p>

<h3 id="6grudges">6. Grudges</h3>

<p>In any discussion, there is a general expectation that everyone there is participating in good faith &ndash; that they have an open mind, no particular agenda, and no bias against the participants or the topic. While short term disagreement is fine, it's important that the people in your community have the ability to reset and approach each new topic with a clean(ish) slate. When you don't do that, when people <strong>carry ill will from previous discussions toward the participants or topic into new discussions</strong>, that's a grudge.</p>

<p>Example: Tad strongly disagrees with a decision the community made about not creating a new category to house some discussion he finds problematic. So he now views the other leaders in the community, and the moderators, with great distrust. Tad feels like the community has turned on him, and so he has soured on the community. But he has too much invested here to leave, so Tad now likes to point out all the consequences of this "bad" decision often, and cite it as an example of how the community is going wrong. He also follows another moderator, Steve, around because he views him as the ringleader of the original decision, and continually writes long, critical replies to his posts.</p>

<p>Grudges can easily lead to every other dark community pattern on this list. I cannot emphasize enough how important it is to recognize grudges when they emerge so the community can intervene and point out what's happening, and all the negative consequences of a grudge. It's important in the broadest general life sense not to hold grudges; as the famous quote goes (as near as I can tell, attributed to <a href="http://www.fakebuddhaquotes.com/holding-onto-anger-is-like-drinking-poison/">Alcoholics Anonymous</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Holding a grudge is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So your community should be educating itself about the danger of grudges, the root of so many other community problems. But it is <em>critically</em> important that moderators never, and I mean never <em>ever</em>, hold grudges. That'd be disastrous.</p>

<h3 id="whatcanyoudo">What can <em>you</em> do?</h3>

<p>I made a joke in the title of this post about weaponizing empathy. I'm not sure that's even possible. But you can start by having <a href="http://blog.discourse.org/2013/03/the-universal-rules-of-civilized-discourse/">clear community guidelines</a>, teaching your community to <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/your-community-door/">close the door on overt hate</a>, and watching out for any overall empathy erosion caused by the six dark community behavior patterns I outlined above.</p>

<p>At the risk of sounding aspirational, here's one thing I know to be true, and I advise every community to take to heart: <strong>I expect you to act like a group of friends who care about each other</strong>, no matter how dumb some of us might be, no matter what political opinions some of us hold, no matter what things some of us like or dislike.</p>

<div class="itemcontent" name="decodeable"><p>What are the real world consequences to signing up for a Twitter or Facebook account through Tor and spewing hate toward other human beings? </p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Facebook reviewed the comment I reported and found it doesn&#39;t violate their Community Standards. <a href="http://t.co/p9syG7oPM1">pic.twitter.com/p9syG7oPM1</a></p>&mdash; Rob Beschizza (@Beschizza) <a href="https://twitter.com/Beschizza/status/522521187533201408">October 15, 2014</a></blockquote>  

<script async src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>As far as I can tell, nothing. There are barely any <em>online</em> consequences, even if the content is reported. </p>

<p><em>But there should be.</em></p>

<p>The problem is that Twitter and Facebook aim to be discussion platforms for "everyone", where every person, no matter how hateful and crazy they may be, gets a turn on the microphone. They get to be heard.</p>

<p><a href="http://xkcd.com/1357/"><img src="http://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2014/10/free_speech.png" alt="" title=""></a></p>

<p>The hover text for this one is so good it deserves escalation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I can't remember where I heard this, but someone once said that defending a position by citing free speech is sort of the ultimate concession; <strong>you're saying that the most compelling thing you can say for your position is that it's not literally illegal to express.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the discussion platform you're using aims to be a public platform for the whole world, there are some pretty terrible things people can do and say to other people there with no real consequences, under the noble banner of free speech. </p>

<p><a href="http://wondermark.com/1k62/"><img src="http://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2014/10/2014-09-19-1062sea.png" alt="" title=""></a></p>

<p>It can be challenging.</p>

<p>How do we show people like this the door? You can block, you can hide, you can mute. But what you <em>can't</em> do is show them the door, because  <strong>it's not your house</strong>. It's Facebook's house. It's their door, and the rules say the whole world has to be accommodated within the Facebook community. So mute and block and so forth are the only options available. But they are anemic, barely workable options. </p>

<p>As we build <a href="http://www.discourse.org/">Discourse</a>, I've discovered that I am deeply opposed to mute and block functions. I think that's because the whole concept of Discourse is that <strong>it <em>is</em> your house</strong>. And mute and ignore, while arguably unavoidable for large worldwide communities, are actively dangerous for smaller communities. Here's why.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>It allows you to ignore bad behavior</strong>. If someone is hateful or harassing, why complain? Just mute. No more problem. Except everyone else still gets to see a person being hateful or harassing to another human being in public. Which means you are now sending a message to all other readers that this is behavior that is OK and accepted in your house. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>It puts the burden on the user</strong>. A kind of victim blaming &mdash; if someone is rude to you, then "why didn't you just mute / block them?" The solution is right there in front of you, why didn't you learn to use the software right? Why don't you take some responsibility and take action to stop the person abusing you? Every single time it happens, over and over again?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It does not address the problematic behavior</strong>. A mute is invisible to everyone. So the person who is getting muted by 10 other users is getting <em>zero</em> feedback that their behavior is causing problems. It's also giving <em>zero</em> feedback to moderators that this person should probably get an intervention at the very least, if not outright suspended. It's so bad that people are building their own <a href="http://www.theblockbot.com/">crowdsourced block lists for Twitter</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It causes discussions to break down</strong>. Fine, you mute someone, so you "never" see that person's posts. But then another user you like quotes the muted user in their post, or references their @name, or replies to their post. Do you then suppress just the quoted section? Suppress the @name? Suppress all replies to their posts, too? This leaves big holes in the conversation and presents many hairy technical challenges. Given enough personal mutes and blocks and ignores, all conversation becomes a <a href="http://www.darklegacycomics.com/424">weird patchwork</a> of partially visible statements.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>This is your house and your rules</strong>. This isn't Twitter or Facebook or some other giant public website with an expectation that "everyone" will be welcome. This is your house, with your rules, and your community. If someone can't behave themselves to the point that they are consistently rude and obnoxious and unkind to others, you don't ask the other people in the house to please ignore it &ndash; <em>you ask them to leave your house</em>. Engendering some weird expectation of "everyone is allowed here" sends the wrong message.  Otherwise your house no longer belongs to you, and that's a very bad place to be.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I worry that people are learning the wrong lessons from the way Twitter and Facebook <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/10/the-unsafety-net-how-social-media-turned-against-women/381261/?single_page=true">poorly handle these situations</a>. Their hands are tied because they aspire to be these global communities where free speech trumps basic human decency and empathy.</p>

<p>The greatest power of online discussion communities, in my experience, is that they <em>don't</em> aspire to be global. You set up a clubhouse with <a href="http://blog.discourse.org/2013/03/the-universal-rules-of-civilized-discourse/">reasonable rules your community agrees upon</a>, and <strong>anyone who can't abide by those rules needs to be gently shown the door.</strong></p>

<p>Don't pull this wishy washy non-committal stuff that Twitter and Facebook do. Community rules are only meaningful if they are actively enforced. You need to be willing to say this to people, at times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No, your behavior is not acceptable in our community; "free speech" doesn't mean we are obliged to host your content, or listen to you being a jerk to people. This is our house, and our rules.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If they don't like it, fortunately there's a whole Internet of other communities out there. They can go try a different house. Or <a href="http://blog.discourse.org/2014/04/install-discourse-in-under-30-minutes/">build their own</a>.</p>

<p>The goal isn't to slam the door in people's faces &ndash; visitors should always be greeted in good faith, with a hearty smile &ndash; but simply to acknowledge that in those rare but inevitable cases where good faith breaks down, a well-oiled front door will save your community.</p>

<h5 class="itemposttime">
<span>Posted:</span>Thu, 09 Oct 2014 22:21:16 GMT</h5>
<div class="itemcontent" name="decodeable"><p>Way back in 2007, before Stack Overflow was a glint in anyone's eye, I called software development a <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/software-development-as-a-collaborative-game/">collaborative game</a>. And perhaps Stack Overflow was the natural outcome of that initial thought &ndash; recasting online software development discussion into a collaborative game where the only way to "win" is to learn from each other.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2014/10/6a0120a85dcdae970b0120a86d6821970b-pi.png" alt=""></p>

<p>That was <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-gamification/">before the word gamification existed</a>. But gamification is no longer the cool, hip concept it was back in 2011. Still, whether you call yourself a "gamer" or not, whether you believe in "gamification" or not, five years later <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-worlds-largest-mmorpg-youre-playing-it-right-now/">you're still playing the world's largest multiplayer game</a>.</p>

<p>In fact, you're playing it right now.</p>

<p>One of the most timeless aspects of games is how egalitarian they are, how easy it is for  anyone to get started. Men, women, children &mdash; people love games because everyone can play along. You don't have to take classes or go to college or be certified: <em>you just play</em>.  And this is, not so incidentally, how many of the programmers I know came to be programmers.</p>

<p>Do you know anyone that bought the video game Halo, or Myst, then proceeded to open the box and read the manual before playing the game? <em>Whoa there guys, we can't play the game yet, we gotta read these instructions first!</em> No, they stopped making manuals for games a long time ago, unless you count the thin sheet of paper that describes how to download / install the game on your device. Because they found out <a href="http://idratherbewriting.com/2009/12/27/if-no-one-reads-the-manual-thats-okay/">nobody reads the manual</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The project I’m working on is critical, but it has only about 3 to 4 users, most of whom are already familiar the application. One of the users even drives the design. The manual I’m writing, which is nearly 200 pages, is mostly a safety measure for business continuity planning. I don’t expect anyone will ever read it.</p>
  
  <p>It’s a project I managed to procrastinate for months, working on other projects, even outside the scope of my regular assignments. The main deterrent, I believe, was my perception that no one needed the manual. The users seemed to be getting along fine without it.</p>
  
  <p>And so as the year ticked to a close, instead of learning more about Mediawiki and screencasting and After Effects, I spent my time updating a 200-page manual that I don’t think anyone will ever read. It will be printed out, three-hole punched, and placed in a binder to collect dust on a shelf.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I guess that's not surprising for games. Games are supposed to be fun, and reading manuals isn't fun; it's pretty much the opposite of fun. But it is also true for software in general. Reading manuals isn't <em>work</em>, at least, it isn't whatever specific thing you set out to do when you fired up that bit of software on your phone, tablet, or laptop.</p>

<p>Games have another clever trick up their sleeve, though. Have you ever noticed that in most of today's games, the first level is kind of easy. Like&hellip; <em>suspiciously</em> easy? </p>

<p>That's because level one, the intro stage, isn't really part of the game. <strong>It's the manual.</strong></p>

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/8FpigqfcvlM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>As MegaMan X illustrates, manuals are pointless when we can learn about the game in the best and most natural way imaginable: by <em>playing the actual game</em>. You learn by doing, provided you have a well designed sandbox that lets you safely experiment as you're starting out in the game.</p>

<p>(The above video does contain some slightly NSFW language, as well as abuse of cartoon female avatars that I don't endorse, but it is utterly brilliant, applies to every app, software and website anyone has ever built, and I strongly recommend watching it all.)</p>

<p>This same philosophy applies to today's software and websites. Don't bother with all the manuals, video introductions, tutorials, and pop-up help dialogs. Nobody's going to read that stuff, at least, not the people who need it.</p>

<p>Instead, follow the lesson of MegaMan: if you want to teach people about your software, consider how you can <strong>build a great intro stage</strong> and let them start playing with it immediately.</p>

<a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/standard-markdown-is-now-common-markdown/">Standard Markdown is now Common Markdown</a>
</h4>
<h5 class="itemposttime">
<span>Posted:</span>Fri, 05 Sep 2014 00:23:57 GMT</h5>
<div class="itemcontent" name="decodeable"><p>Let me open with an apology to John Gruber for <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/standard-flavored-markdown/">my previous blog post</a>.</p>

<p>We've been working on the Standard Markdown project for about two years now. We invited John Gruber, the original creator of Markdown, to join the project via email in November 2012, but never heard back. As we got closer to being ready for public feedback, we emailed John on August 19th with a link to the Standard Markdown spec, asking him for his feedback. Since John MacFarlane was the primary author of most of the work, we suggested that he be the one to reach out.</p>

<p>We then waited two weeks for a response.</p>

<p>There was no response, so we assumed that John Gruber was either OK with the project (and its name), or didn't care. So we proceeded.</p>

<p>There was lots of internal discussion about what to name our project. Strict Markdown? XMarkdown? Markdown Pro? Markdown Super Hyper Turbo Pro Alpha Diamond Edition? </p>

<p>As we were finalizing the name, we noticed on this podcast, at 1:15 &hellip;</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/159439009&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe>

<p>&hellip; that John seemed OK with the name "GitHub Flavored Markdown". So I originally wrote the blog post and the homepage using that terminology &ndash; "Standard Flavored Markdown" &ndash; and even kept that as the title of the blog post to signify our intent. We were building Yet Another Flavor of Markdown, one designed to remove ambiguity by specifying a standard, while preserving as much as possible the spirit of Markdown and compatibility with existing documents.</p>

<p>Before we went live, I asked for feedback internally, and one of the bits of feedback I got was that it was inconsistent to say Standard Flavored Markdown on the homepage and blog when the spec says Standard Markdown throughout. So I changed them to match Standard Markdown, and that's what we launched with.</p>

<p>It was a bit of a surprise to get an email last night, addressed to both me and John MacFarlane, from John Gruber indicating that the name Standard Markdown was "infuriating". </p>

<p>I'm sorry the name is so infuriating. <strong>I assure you that we did <em>not</em> choose the name to make you, or anyone else, angry.</strong> We were simply trying to pick a name that correctly and accurately reflected our goal &ndash; to build an unambiguous flavor of Markdown. If the name we chose made inappropriate overtures about Standard Markdown being anything more than a highly specified flavor of Markdown, I apologize. Standard does have certain particular computer science meanings, as in IETF Standard, ECMA Standard. That was not our intent, it was more of an aspirational element of "what if, together, we could eventually..". What can I say? We're programmers. We name things literally. And <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/i-shall-call-it-somethingmanager/">naming is hard</a>.</p>

<p>John Gruber was also very upset, and I think rightfully so, that the word Markdown was not capitalized throughout the spec. This was an oversight on our part &ndash; and also my fault because I <em>did</em> notice Markdown wasn't capitalized as I copied snippets of the spec to the homepage and blog post, and I definitely thought it was odd, too. You'll note that I took care to manually capitalize Markdown in the parts of the spec I copied to the blog post and home page &ndash; but I neglected to mention this to John MacFarlane as I should have. We corrected this immediately when it was brought to our attention. </p>

<p>John then made three requests:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Rename the project.</p></li>
<li><p>Shut down the standardmarkdown.com domain, and don't redirect it.</p></li>
<li><p>Apologize.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>All fair. Happy to do all of those things.</p>

<p>Starting with the name. In his email John graciously indicated that he would "probably" approve a name like "Strict Markdown" or "Pedantic Markdown". Given the very public earlier miscommunication about naming, that consideration is appreciated.</p>

<p>We replied with the following suggestions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Compatible Markdown</li>
<li>Regular Markdown</li>
<li>Community Markdown</li>
<li>Common Markdown</li>
<li>Uniform Markdown</li>
<li>Vanilla Markdown</li>
</ul>

<p>We haven't heard back after replying last night, and I'm not sure we ever will, so in the interest of moving ahead and avoiding conflict, we're immediately renaming the project to <strong>Common Markdown</strong>.</p>

<p>We hope that is an acceptable name; it was independently suggested to us several times in several different feedback areas. The intention is to avoid any unwanted overtones of ownership; we have only ever wanted to be Yet Another Flavor of Markdown.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The project name change is already in progress.</p></li>
<li><p>This is our public apology.</p></li>
<li><p>I'll shut down the standardmarkdown.com domain as soon as I can, probably by tomorrow.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>John, we deeply apologize for the miscommunication. It's our fault, and we want to fix it. But even though we made mistakes, I hope it is clear that everything we've done, we did solely out of a shared love of Markdown (and its simple, unencumbered old-school ASCII origins), and the desire to ensure the success of Markdown as a stable format for future generations.</p>

<p>Edit: after a long and thoughtful email from John Gruber &ndash; which is greatly appreciated &ndash; he indicated that no form of the word "Markdown" is acceptable to him in this case. We are now using the name <a href="http://commonmark.org/"><strong>CommonMark</strong></a>.</p>

<span>Posted:</span>Wed, 03 Sep 2014 20:06:30 GMT</h5>
<div class="itemcontent" name="decodeable"><p>In 2009 I <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/responsible-open-source-code-parenting/">lamented the state of Markdown</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Right now we have the worst of both worlds. Lack of leadership from the top, and a bunch of fragmented, poorly coordinated community efforts to advance Markdown, none of which are officially canon. This isn't merely incovenient for anyone trying to find accurate information about Markdown; it's actually harming the project's future. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In late 2012, David Greenspan from <a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a> approached me and proposed we move forward, and <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-future-of-markdown/">a project crystallized</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I propose that Stack Exchange, GitHub, Meteor, Reddit, and any other company with lots of traffic and a strategic investment in Markdown, all work together to <strong>come up with an official Markdown specification, and standard test suites to validate Markdown implementations</strong>. We've all been working at cross purposes for too long, accidentally fragmenting Markdown while popularizing it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We formed a small private working group with key representatives from GitHub, from Reddit, from Stack Exchange, from the open source community. We spent months hashing out the details and agreeing on the necessary changes to turn Markdown into a language you can parse without feeling like you just walked through a sewer &ndash; while preserving the simple, clear, ASCII email inspired spirit of Markdown.</p>

<p>We really struggled with this at <a href="http://www.discourse.org/">Discourse</a>, which is also based on Markdown, but an even more complex dialect than the one we built at Stack Overflow. In Discourse, you can mix <em>three</em> forms of markup interchangeably:</p>

<ul>
<li>Markdown</li>
<li>HTML (safe subset)</li>
<li>BBCode (subset)</li>
</ul>

<p>Discourse is primarily a JavaScript app, so naturally we needed a nice, compliant implementation of Markdown in JavaScript. Surely such a thing exists, yes? Nope. Even in 2012, we found <em>zero</em> JavaScript implementations of Markdown that could pass the only Markdown test suite I know of, <a href="https://github.com/michelf/mdtest/">MDTest</a>. It isn't authoritative, it's a community created initiative that embodies its own decisions about rendering ambiguities in Markdown, but it's all we've got. We contributed many <a href="https://github.com/evilstreak/markdown-js/commits/master">upstream fixes to markdown.js</a> to make it pass MDTest &ndash; but it still only passes in our locally extended version.</p>

<p>As an open source project ourselves, we're perfectly happy contributing upstream code to improve it for everyone. But it's an indictment of the state of the Markdown ecosystem that any remotely popular implementation wasn't already testing itself against a formal spec and test suite. But who can blame them, because <i>it didn't exist!</i></p>

<p>Well, now it does.</p>

<p>It took a while, but I'm pleased to announce that <a href="http://standardmarkdown.com/"><strong>Standard Markdown</strong></a> is now finally ready for public review.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://standardmarkdown.com/">standardmarkdown.com</a></strong></p>

<p>It's a spec, including embedded examples, and implementations in portable C and JavaScript. We strived mightily to stay true to the spirit of Markdown in writing it. The primary author, John MacFarlane, <a href="http://spec.standardmarkdown.com/">explains in the introduction to the spec</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because Gruber’s syntax description leaves many aspects of the syntax undetermined, writing a precise spec requires making a large number of decisions, many of them somewhat arbitrary. In making them, I have appealed to existing conventions and considerations of simplicity, readability, expressive power, and consistency. I have tried to ensure that “normal” documents in the many incompatible existing implementations of markdown will render, as far as possible, as their authors intended. And I have tried to make the rules for different elements work together harmoniously. In places where different decisions could have been made (for example, the rules governing list indentation), I have explained the rationale for my choices. In a few cases, I have departed slightly from the canonical syntax description, in ways that I think further the goals of markdown as stated in that description.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Part of my contribution to the project is to host the discussion / mailing list for Standard Markdown in a Discourse instance. </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://talk.standardmarkdown.com/">talk.standardmarkdown.com</a></strong></p>

<p>Fortunately, Discourse itself <a href="http://blog.discourse.org/2014/08/introducing-discourse-1-0/">just reached version 1.0</a>. If the only thing Standard Markdown does is help save a few users from the continuing horror that is mailing list web UI, we all win.</p>

<p>What I'm most excited about is that we got a massive contribution from the one person who, in my mind, was the most perfect person in the world to work on this project: <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/">John MacFarlane</a>. He took our feedback and wrote the entire Standard Markdown spec and both implementations.</p>

<p><a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/"><img src="http://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2014/Sep/JohnPinhole.jpg" alt="" title=""></a></p>

<p>A lot of people know of John through his <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">Pandoc</a> project, which is amazing in its own right, but I found out about him because he built <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/babelmark2/faq.html">Babelmark</a>. I learned to refer to Babelmark extensively while working on Stack Overflow and MarkdownSharp, a C# implementation of Markdown.</p>

<p>Here's how crazy Markdown is: to decide what the "correct" behavior is, you provide sample Markdown input to 20+ different Markdown parsers &hellip; and then pray that some consensus emerges in all their output. That's what Babelmark does.</p>

<p>Consider this simple Markdown example:</p>

<pre><code># Hello there

This is a paragraph.

- one
- two
- three
- four

1. pirate
2. ninja
3. zombie
</code></pre>

<p>Just for that, I count <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/babelmark2/?text=%23+Hello+there%0A%0AThis+is+a+paragraph.%0A%0A-+one%0A-+two%0A-+three%0A-+four%0A%0A1.+pirate%0A2.+ninja%0A3.+zombie"><em>fifteen</em> different rendered outputs</a> from 22 different Markdown parsers.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel"><img src="http://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2014/Sep/Confusion_of_Tongues.png" alt="" title=""></a></p>

<p>In Markdown, we <em>literally</em> built a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel">Tower of Babel</a>. </p>

<p>Have I mentioned that it's a good idea for a language to have a formal specification and test suites? Maybe now you can see why that is.</p>

<p>Oh, and in his spare time, John is also the chair of the department of philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley. <em>No big deal.</em> While I don't mean to minimize the contributions of anyone to the Standard Markdown project, we all owe a special thanks to John.</p>

<p>Markdown is indeed everywhere. And that's a good thing. But it needs to be sane, parseable, and standard. That's the goal of <a href="http://standardmarkdown.com/">Standard Markdown</a> &mdash; but we need your help to get there. If you use Markdown on a website, <strong>ask what it would take for that site to become compatible with Standard Markdown</strong>; when you see the word "Markdown" you have the right to expect consistent rendering across all the websites you visit. If you implement Markdown, <a href="http://spec.standardmarkdown.com/">take a look at the spec</a>, try to <strong>make your parser compatible with Standard Markdown</strong>, and <a href="http://talk.standardmarkdown.com/">discuss improvements or refinements</a> to the spec.</p>

<p><span style="color:red;">Update:</span> The project was renamed <a href="http://commonmark.org/">CommonMark</a>. See <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/standard-markdown-is-now-common-markdown/">my subsequent blog post</a>.</p>

<span>Posted:</span>Fri, 18 Jul 2014 00:05:23 GMT</h5>
<div class="itemcontent" name="decodeable"><p>I've long believed that the design of your software has a profound impact on how users <em>behave</em> within your software. But there are two sides to this story:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Encouraging the "right" things by making those things intentionally easy to do.</p></li>
<li><p>Discouraging the "wrong" things by making those things intentionally difficult, complex, and awkward to do.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Whether the software is doing this intentionally, or completely accidentally, it's a fact of life: <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/training-your-users/">the path of least resistance is everyone's best friend</a>. Learn to master this path, or others will master it for you.</p>

<p>For proof, consider Dan Ariely's new and amazing book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0062183613?tag=codihorr-20">The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty: How We Lie to Everyone &ndash; Especially Ourselves</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0062183613?tag=codihorr-20"><img src="http://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2014/Jul/the-honest-truth-about-dishonesty-cover.png" alt="" title=""></a></p>

<p>Indeed, let's be honest: <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/every-user-lies/">we all lie, all the time</a>. Not because we're bad people, mind you, but because we <em>have</em> to regularly lie to ourselves as <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-trap-you-set-for-yourself/">a survival mechanism</a>. You think we should be completely honest all the time? Yeah. <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/trust-me-im-lying/">Good luck with that</a>.</p>

<p>But these healthy little white lies we learn to tell ourselves have a darker side. Have you ever heard <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304840904577422090013997320?mod=wsj_share_tweet">this old adage?</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One day, Peter locked himself out of his house. After a spell, the locksmith pulled up in his truck and picked the lock in about a minute.</p>
  
  <p>“I was amazed at how quickly and easily this guy was able to open the door,” Peter said. The locksmith told him that locks are on doors only to keep honest people honest. One percent of people will always be honest and never steal. Another 1% will always be dishonest and always try to pick your lock and steal your television; locks won’t do much to protect you from the hardened thieves, who can get into your house if they really want to.</p>
  
  <p><strong>The purpose of locks, the locksmith said, is to protect you from the 98% of mostly honest people who might be tempted to try your door if it had no lock.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had heard this expressed less optimistically before as</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>10% of people will <em>never</em> steal, 10% of people will <em>always</em> steal, and for everyone else &hellip; it depends.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The "it depends" part is crucial to understanding human nature, and that's what Ariely spends most of the book examining in various tests. If for most people, honesty depends, what exactly does it depend on? The experiments Ariely conducts prove again and again that <strong>most people will consistently and reliably cheat "just a little", to the extent that they can still consider themselves honest people.</strong> The gating factor isn't laws, penalties, or ethics. Surprisingly, that stuff has virtually no effect on behavior. What does, though, is whether they can personally still <em>feel</em> like they are honest people.</p>

<p>This is because they don't even consider it cheating &ndash; they're just taking a little extra, giving themselves a tiny break, enjoying a minor boost, because well, haven't they been working extra specially hard lately and earned it? Don't they of all people deserve something nice once in a while, and who would even miss this tiny amount? There's so much!</p>

<p>These little white lies are the path of least resistance. They are everywhere. If laws don't work, if ethics classes don't work, if severe penalties don't work, how do you encourage people to behave in a way that "feels" honest that is actually, you know, <em>honest?</em> Feelings are some pretty squishy stuff.</p>

<p>It's <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304840904577422090013997320?mod=wsj_share_tweet">easier than you think</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My colleagues and I ran an experiment at the University of California, Los Angeles. We took a group of 450 participants, split them into two groups and set them loose on our usual matrix task. We asked half of them to recall the Ten Commandments and the other half to recall 10 books that they had read in high school.</p>
  
  <p>Among the group who recalled the 10 books, we saw the typical widespread but moderate cheating. But in the group that was asked to recall the Ten Commandments, we observed no cheating whatsoever. We reran the experiment, reminding students of their schools' honor codes instead of the Ten Commandments, and we got the same result. We even reran the experiment on a group of self-declared atheists, asking them to swear on a Bible, and got the same no-cheating results yet again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's the good news: <strong>a simple reminder <em>at the time of the temptation</em></strong> is usually all it takes for people to suddenly "remember" their honesty.</p>

<p>The bad news is Clippy was right.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2014/Jul/clippy-suicide.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In my experience, nobody reads manuals, nobody reads FAQs, and nobody reads tutorials. I am exaggerating a little here for effect, of course. Some A+ students will go out of their way to read these things. That's how they became A+ students, by naturally going the extra mile, and generally being the kind of users who teach themselves perfectly well without needing special resources to get there. When I say "nobody" I mean the vast overwhelming massive majority of people you would really, <em>really</em> want to <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/treating-user-myopia/">read things like that</a>. People who don't have the time or inclination to expend any effort at all other than the absolute minimum required, people who are most definitely <em>not</em> going to go the extra mile.</p>

<p>In other words, the whole world.</p>

<p>So how do you help people who, like us, just never seem to have the time to figure this stuff out becase they're, like, <em>suuuuper</em> busy and stuff?</p>

<p>You do it by showing them &hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>the minumum helpful reminder</li>
<li>at exactly the right time</li>
</ul>

<p>This is what I've called the  "Just In Time" theory of user behavior for years. Sure, FAQs and tutorials and help centers are great and all, but who has the time for that? We're <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/defending-perpetual-intermediacy/">all perpetual intermediates here</a>, at best. </p>

<p>The closer you can get your software to practical, useful "Just In Time" reminders, the better you can help the users who are most in need. Not the A+ students who already read the FAQ, and studied the help center intently, but those users who <em>never read anything</em>. And now, thanks to Dan Ariely, I have the science to back this up. Even something as simple as putting your name on the top of a form to report auto insurance milage, rather than the bottom, resulted in a mysterious 10% increase in average miles reported. Having that little reminder <em>right at the start</em> that hey, your name is here on this form, inspired additional honesty. It works.</p>

<p>Did we use this technique on Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange? Indeed we did. Do I use this technique on <a href="http://www.discourse.org/">Discourse</a>? You bet, in even more places, because this is social discussion, not technical Q&amp;A. We are rather <a href="http://blog.discourse.org/2013/03/the-universal-rules-of-civilized-discourse/">big on civility</a>, so we like to remind people when they post on Discourse they aren't talking to a computer or a robot, but <a href="http://sivers.org/real">a real person, a lot like you</a>. </p>

<p>When's the natural time to remind someone of this? Not when they sign up, not when they're reading, but <em>at the very moment they begin typing their first words in their first post</em>. This is the moment of temptation when you might be super mega convinced that <a href="http://xkcd.com/386/">someone is Wrong on the Internet</a>. So we put up a gentle little reminder Just In Time, right above where they are typing:</p>

<p><a href="http://discourse.soylent.me/"><img src="http://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2014/Jul/discourse-new-user-civility-reminder.png" alt="" title=""></a></p>

<p>Then hopefully, as Dan Ariely showed us with honesty, this little reminder will tap into people's natural reserves of friendliness and civility, so cooler heads will prevail &ndash; and a few people are inspired to get along a little better than they did yesterday. Just because you're on the Internet doesn't mean you need to be yelling at folks 24/7.</p>

<p>We use this same technique a bunch of other places: if you are posting a lot but haven't set an avatar, if you are adding a new post to a particularly old conversation, if you are replying a bunch of times in the same topic, and so forth. Wherever we feel a gentle nudge might help, at the exact time the behavior is occurring.</p>

<p>It's important to understand that we use these reminders in <a href="http://www.discourse.org/">Discourse</a> not because we believe people are dumb;  quite the contrary, we use them because <strong>we believe people are smart, civil, and interesting.</strong> Turns out everyone just needs to be reminded of that once in a while for it to continue to be true.</p>

<h5 class="itemposttime">
<span>Posted:</span>Fri, 16 May 2014 20:42:56 GMT</h5>
<div class="itemcontent" name="decodeable"><p>Computer performance is <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/">a bit of a shell game</a>. You're always waiting for one of four things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Disk</li>
<li>CPU</li>
<li>Memory</li>
<li>Network</li>
</ul>

<p>But which one? How long will you wait? And what will you do while you're waiting?</p>

<p>Did you see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1798709">the movie "Her"</a>? If not, you should. It's great. One of my favorite scenes is the AI describing just how difficult it becomes to communicate with humans:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It's like I'm reading a book&hellip; and it's a book I deeply love. But I'm reading it slowly now. So the words are really far apart and the spaces between the words are almost infinite. I can still feel you&hellip; and the words of our story&hellip; but it's in this endless space between the words that I'm finding myself now. It's a place that's not of the physical world. It's where everything else is that I didn't even know existed. I love you so much. But this is where I am now. And this who I am now. And I need you to let me go. As much as I want to, I can't live your book any more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have some serious reservations about the work environment pictured in Her where everyone's spending all day creepily whispering to their computers, but there is deep fundamental truth in that one pivotal scene. That infinite space "between" what we humans feel as time is where computers spend <em>all</em> their time. It's an entirely different timescale.</p>

<p>The book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0133390098/?tag=codihorr-20">Systems Performance: Enterprise and the Cloud</a> has a great table that illustrates just how enormous these time differentials are. Just translate computer time into arbitrary seconds:</p>

<table width="600px">  
<tr><td>1 CPU cycle</td><td>0.3 ns</td><td>1 s</td></tr>  
<tr><td>Level 1 cache access</td><td>0.9 ns</td><td>3 s</td></tr>  
<tr><td>Level 2 cache access</td><td>2.8 ns</td><td>9 s</td></tr>  
<tr><td>Level 3 cache access</td><td>12.9 ns</td><td>43 s</td></tr>  
<tr><td>Main memory access</td><td>120 ns</td><td>6 min</td></tr>  
<tr><td>Solid-state disk I/O</td><td>50-150 μs</td><td>2-6 days</td></tr>  
<tr><td>Rotational disk I/O</td><td>1-10 ms</td><td>1-12 months</td></tr>  
<tr><td>Internet: SF to NYC</td><td>40 ms</td><td>4 years</td></tr>  
<tr><td>Internet: SF to UK</td><td>81 ms</td><td>8 years</td></tr>  
<tr><td>Internet: SF to Australia</td><td>183 ms</td><td>19 years</td></tr>  
<tr><td>OS virtualization reboot</td><td>4 s</td><td>423 years</td></tr>  
<tr><td>SCSI command time-out</td><td>30 s</td><td>3000 years</td></tr>  
<tr><td>Hardware virtualization reboot</td><td>40 s</td><td>4000 years</td></tr>  
<tr><td>Physical system reboot</td><td>5 m</td><td>32 millenia</td></tr>  
</table>

<p>The above Internet times are kind of optimistic. If you look at <a href="http://ipnetwork.bgtmo.ip.att.net/pws/network_delay.html">the AT&amp;T real time US internet latency chart</a>, the time from SF to NYC is more like 70ms. So I'd double the Internet numbers in that chart.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2014/May/internet-latency-usa.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Latency is one thing, but it's also worth considering <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-economics-of-bandwidth/">the cost of that bandwidth</a>.</p>

<p>Speaking of the late, great <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Gray_(computer_scientist)">Jim Gray</a>, he also <a href="http://loci.cs.utk.edu/dsi/netstore99/docs/presentations/keynote/sld023.htm">had an interesting way of explaining this</a>. If the CPU registers are how long it takes you to fetch data from your brain, then <strong>going to disk is the equivalent of fetching data from Pluto.</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2014/May/storage-latency-how-far-away-is-the-data.png" alt=""></p>

<p>He was probably referring to traditional spinning rust hard drives, so let's adjust that extreme endpoint for today:</p>

<ul>
<li>Distance to Pluto: 4.67 billion miles.</li>
<li>Latest fastest spinning HDD performance (<a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/5729/western-digital-velociraptor-1tb-wd1000dhtz-review/3">49.7</a>) versus latest fastest PCI Express SSD (<a href="http://anandtech.com/show/8006/samsung-ssd-xp941-review-the-pcie-era-is-here/6">506.8</a>). That's an improvement of 10x.</li>
<li>New distance: 467 million miles.</li>
<li>Distance to Jupiter: 500 million miles.</li>
</ul>

<p>So instead of travelling to Pluto to get our data from disk in 1999, <strong>today we only need to travel to &hellip; Jupiter</strong>. </p>

<p><img src="http://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2014/May/solar-system-distances.png" alt=""></p>

<p>That's disk performance over the last decade. How much faster did CPUs, memory, and networks get in the same time frame? Would a 10x or 100x improvement really make a dent in these vast infinite spaces in time that computers deal with?</p>

<p>To computers, we humans work on a completely different time scale, practically <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_far_future">geologic time</a>. Which is completely mind-bending. The faster computers get, the bigger this time disparity grows. </p>

<a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/what-can-men-do/">What Can Men Do?</a>
</h4>
<h5 class="itemposttime">
<span>Posted:</span>Fri, 25 Apr 2014 08:06:10 GMT</h5>
<div class="itemcontent" name="decodeable"><p>(The title references Shanley Kane's <a href="https://medium.com/tech-culture-briefs/a1e93d985af0">post by the same name</a>. This post represents my views on what men can do.)</p>

<p>It's no secret that programming is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_computing#The_Gender_Gap">incredibly male dominated field</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Figures vary, but somewhere from 20% to 29% of currently working programmers are female.</p></li>
<li><p>Less than 12% of Computer Science bachelor's degrees were awarded to women at US PhD-granting institutions in 2010.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So, on average, only about 1 out of every 5 working programmers you'll encounter will be female. You could say <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/technology/technologys-man-problem.html?_r=0">technology has a man problem</a>.</p>

<p>In an earlier post I noted that <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/software-developers-and-aspergers-syndrome/">many software developers I've known have traits of Aspergers</a>. Aspergers is a spectrum disorder; the more severe the symptoms, the closer it is to autism. And did you know that autism <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology_of_autism">skews heavily towards males at a 4:1 ratio</a>?</p>

<p>Interesting. I might even go so far as to say some of those traits are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/046500556X?tag=codihorr-20">what makes one good at programming</a>. </p>

<p>That's the way it currently is. But is that the way it <em>should be?</em> I remember noticing that the workforce of the maternity ward at the hospital where our children were born was incredibly female dominated. Is there something inherently wrong with professions that naturally skew heavily male or female?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cbs.nl/en-GB/menu/themas/arbeid-sociale-zekerheid/publicaties/artikelen/archief/2005/2005-1825-wm.htm"><img src="http://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2014/Apr/male-vs-female-dominated-fields-2004.png" alt="" title=""></a></p>

<p>Consider <a href="http://www.cbs.nl/en-GB/menu/themas/arbeid-sociale-zekerheid/publicaties/artikelen/archief/2005/2005-1825-wm.htm">this list</a> of the most male and female dominated occupations in the Netherlands from 2004. It notes that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In higher and academic level positions, men and women are more often represented equally. This pattern of employment has hardly changed over the last years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is programming a higher and academic level occupation? I'm not so sure, given that <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/please-dont-learn-to-code/">I've compared programmers to auto mechanics and plumbers in the past</a>. And you'll notice squarely where those occupations are on the above graphs. There's nothing wrong with being an auto mechanic or a plumber (or a programmer, for that matter), but is there anything about those particular professions that demands, in the name of social justice, that there must be 50% male plumbers and 50% female plumbers?</p>

<p>For a counterpoint, here's a blog post from Sara J. Chipps. When I've e-mailed her in the past with my stupid questions on topics like this, she tries her best to educate me with empathy and compassion. That's why I love her. </p>

<p>This is an <a href="http://sarajchipps.com/post/55986333661/in-which-i-answer-all-of-the-questions">excerpt from a blog post she wrote in 2012</a> which answered my question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many people I meet ask me a variant of the question “I understand we want more women in technology, but why?” It’s a great question, and not at all something we should be offended by. Often men are afraid to ask questions like this for fear there will be backlash, and I think that fear can lead to stifling an important conversation.</p>
  
  <p>Frankly, the Internet is thriving without women building it, why should that change? Three reasons:</p>
  
  <p><strong>1) Diversity leads to better products and results</strong></p>
  
  <p>As illustrated in <a href="http://web.mit.edu/cortiz/www/Diversity/PDFs/Jehn%20et%20al%201999.pdf">this Cornell study</a> along with many others, diversity improves performance, morale, and end product. More women engineers means building a better internet, and improving software that can service society as a whole. Building a better Internet is why I started doing software development in the first place. I think we can all agree this is of utmost importance.</p>
  
  <p><strong>2) The Internet is the largest recording of human history ever built</strong></p>
  
  <p>Right now the architecture for that platform is being built disproportionally by white and asian males. You’ve heard the phrase “he who writes history makes history”? We don’t yet know how this will affect future generations. </p>
  
  <p>How can architecture be decidedly male? I like to refer to the anecdotal story of the Apple Store glass stairs. While visually appealing, there was one unforeseen consequence to their design: the large groups of strange men that spend hours each day standing under them looking up. As a woman, the first time I saw them I thought “thank god I’m not wearing a skirt today.” Such considerations were not taken in designing these stairs. I think it’s probable, if not easily predictable, that in a few years we will see such holes in the design of the web. </p>
  
  <p><strong>3) Women in 10 years need to be able to provide for themselves, and their families</strong></p>
  
  <p>Now, this reason is purely selfish on the part of women, but we all have mothers, and sisters, so I hope we can relate. </p>
  
  <p>This year there are 6 million information technology jobs in the US, up from 628,600 in 1987 and 1.34 million in 1997. Right now jobs in technology have half the unemployment rate of the rest of the workforce. There is no sign this will change anytime soon. If growth continues at the current rate, it will not be long until women will not be able to sustain themselves if not involved in a technical field. </p>
  
  <p>We have to start educating young girls about this now, or they may ultimately become the poorest demographic among us. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are good reasons. I'm particularly fond of #1. Diversity in social perspectives is hugely valuable when building social software intended for, y'know, human beings of all genders, like <a href="http://www.discourse.org/">Discourse</a> and <a href="http://www.stackexchange.com/">Stack Exchange</a>. Also, I get really, really tired of all the aggressive mansplaining in software development. Yes, even my own. Sometimes it would be good to get some ladysplaining all mixed up in there for variety.</p>

<p>I suppose any effort to encourage more women to become software engineers should ideally start in childhood.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=1883"><img src="http://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2014/Apr/boy-toys-vs-girl-toys.png" alt="boy toys vs girl toys" title=""></a></p>

<p>Dolls? Pshaw. In our household, every child, male or female, is issued a regulation iPad at birth. You know, the best, most complex toy there is: a computer. And, shocker, I'm kind of weird about it &ndash; I <em>religiously</em> refer to it as <strong>a computer</strong>, never as an iPad. Never. Not once. Not gonna happen in my house. Branding is for marketing weasels.  So the twin girls will run around, frantically calling out for their so-called "'puter". It puts a grin on my face every time. And when anything isn't here, Maisie has gotten in the habit of saying "dada chargin'". Where's the milk, Maisie? "dada chargin'".</p>

<p>But not everyone has the luxury of spawning their own processes and starting from boot. (You really should, though. It will <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/on-parenthood/">kick your ass</a>.)</p>

<h3 id="whatcanyoudo">What can you do?</h3>

<p>If you're reading this, there's about an 80% chance that you're a man. So after you give me the secret man club handshake, let's talk about what we men can do, right now, today, to make programming a more welcoming profession for women.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Abide by the Hacker School Rules</strong></p>

<p>Let's start with the <a href="https://www.hackerschool.com/manual#sec-environment">freaking brilliant Hacker School rules</a>. This cuts directly to the unfortunate but oh-so-common Aspergers tendencies in programmers I mentioned earlier:</p>

<ul><li>No feigning surprise. "I can't believe you don't know what the <em>stack</em> is!"</li>
<li>No <a href="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2011/Feb-17.html">well-actuallys</a>. "Well, actually, you can do that without a regular expression."</li>
<li>No back seat driving. Don't intermittently lob advice across the room.</li>
<li>No subtle sexism via public debate. </li></ul>

<p>Does any of this sound familiar? Because it should. Oh <em>God</em> does this sound familar. Just read the whole set of Hacker School guidelines and recognize your natural tendencies, and try to rein them in. That's all I'm proposing.</p>

<p>Well, actually, I'll be proposing a few more things.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Really listen. What? I SAID LISTEN.</strong> </p>

<p>Remember <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHJdCO6Aa6s">this scene</a> in Fight Club?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is why I loved the support groups so much, if people thought you were dying, they gave you their full attention. If this might be the last time they saw you, they really saw you. Everything else about their checkbook balance and radio songs and messy hair went out the window. You had their full attention. <strong>People listened instead of just waiting for their turn to speak.</strong> And when they spoke, they weren't just telling you a story. When the two of you talked, you were building something, and afterward you were both different than before.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Guilty as charged.</p>

<p>My wife is a scientist, and she complains about this happening a lot at her work. I don't even think this one is about sexism, it's about basic respect. What does respect mean? Well, a bunch of things, but let's start with openly listening to people and giving them our full attention when they talk to us &ndash; rather than just waiting for our turn to speak.</p>

<p>Let's shut up and listen quietly with the same thoughtfulness that we wish others would listen to us. We'll get our turn. We always do, don't we?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>If you see bad behavior from other men, speak up.</strong></p>

<p>It's not other people's job to make sure that everyone enjoys a safe, respectful, civil environment at work and online.</p>

<p>It's my job. It's your job. It is <em>our job</em>.</p>

<p>There is no mythical men's club where it is OK to be a jerk to women. If you see any behavior that gives you pause, behavior that makes you wonder "is that OK?", behavior that you'd be uncomfortable with directed toward your sister, your wife, your daughter &ndash; speak up. Honestly, as one man to another. And if that doesn't work for whatever reason, escalate.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Don't attempt romantic relationships at work.</strong></p>

<p>Do you run a company? Institute a no-dating rule as policy. Yeah, I know, you can't truly enforce it, but it should still be the official company policy.   And whether the place where you work has this policy or not, <em>you</em> should have it on a personal level.</p>

<p>I'm sorry I have to be that guy who dumps on true love, but let's be honest: the odds of any random office romance working out are pretty slim. And when it doesn't, how will you handle showing up to work every day and seeing this person? Will there be Capulet vs Montague drama? The women usually get the rough end of this deal, too, because men aren't good at handling the inevitable rejection.</p>

<p>Just don't do it. Have all the romantic relationships you want outside work, but do not bring it to work.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No drinking at work events.</strong></p>

<p>I think it is very, very unwise for companies to have a culture associated with drinking and the lowered inhibitions that come with drinking. I've heard some terrifyingly awful stories that I don't even want to link to here. Men, plus women, plus alcohol is a great recipe for college. That's about all I remember from college, in fact. But as a safe work environment for women? Not so much.</p>

<p>If you want to drink, be my guest. Drink. You're a grown up. I'm not the boss of you. But don't drink in a situation or event that is officially connected with work in <em>any</em> way. That should absolutely be your personal <em>and</em> company policy &ndash; no exceptions.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>There you have it. Five relatively simple things you, I, and all other working male programmers can do to help encourage a better environment for men <em>and</em> women in software plumbing. I mean engineering.</p>

<p>So let's get to it.</p>

<p>(I haven't listed anything here about mentoring. That's because <a href="https://twitter.com/codinghorror/status/25955094175">I am an awful mentor</a>. But please <em>do</em> feel free to mention good resources, like <a href="http://www.girldevelopit.com/">Girl Develop It</a>, that encourage mentoring of female software engineers by people that <em>are</em> actually good at it, in the comments.)</p>

<p>But let's try something simpler, a little experiment. <strong>What do you use to keep track of what you need to do?</strong> Hold it up, so I can see it. Humor me.</p>

<p>Seriously! No no no, hold it closer, near the screen here. Let me look at it. Let me get a <em>good, long</em> look at it.</p>

<p>Now imagine me slapping this thing out of your hand.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2014/Apr/dont-go-there.png" alt="don't go there"></p>

<p>I just want to make a point, not break your fancy whatchamacallit. So pretend I slapped it into a soft fluffy pillow on the ground, not the hard concrete of the sidewalk. Though I probably should have.</p>

<p>Whatever that thing is, it's a crutch. You don't need it. It's <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/todont/">hurting you more than it is helping</a>. Get rid of it.</p>

<p>You should be able to instantly answer this simple question, each day, every day, for the rest of your life. <em>Without</em> any tools other than the brain you were born with.</p>

<p>If you don't have this skill, develop it. Practice, starting today. Right now.</p>

<p>What <em>are</em> you doing right now? Is it going to somehow result in one of those three things getting done today? Will this you get you to where you need to be by the end of the day?</p>

<p>I'm not asking you to admonish yourself or to make any changes to your routine. Just keep it simple, focus on the important things, and add a little layer of awareness. </p>

<p>So. Two items left. I'm doing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_05qJTeNNI">pretty good</a> today. </p>

<script async src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>In 2006 I said that <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/a-blog-without-comments-is-not-a-blog/">a blog without comments is not a blog</a> and I stand behind that statement. There have been brief periods where my own blog has been <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/welcome-back-comments/">temporarily without comments</a>, but they will always come back as long as I'm in charge here.</p>

<p>I'm a fan of comments, warts and all. They're noisy, sure, but in my experience they reliably produce crowdsourced knowledge in aggregate. I understand being pressed for time, but if you want the complete picture, in the same way that you should follow all those little citation links in Wikipedia articles, <strong>you should read the comments</strong>.</p>

<p>I empathize with the <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/10/25/im_never_reading_the_comments_again/">complaint</a>, believe me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I used to believe that as an online writer, I had an obligation to read the comments. I thought that it was important from a fact-checking perspective, that it somehow would help me grow as a writer. What I’ve learned is that if there’s something wrong or important or even, sometimes, good about a story, someone will let you know. I’ve over the years amassed an amazing community of Salon readers who engage via email, who challenge me, who inspire new stories, who are decent people and treat me like one in return. What I was getting in the comments was a lot of anonymous “You suck, bitch.”</p>
  
  <p>I admit it’s depressing for one who’s invested almost her entire career in online community to throw in the towel on it in this way. I want it to be better. But it’s just not. As a colleague once observed, “I just can’t take another letter from Angry Bad Divorce Guy.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But that's so many pesky <em>words</em>, isn't it? TL;DR. Allow me to illustrate with a graph that your brain can absorb in milliseconds:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2696"><img src="http://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2014/Mar/esteem_for_humanity_comments.png" alt="comments and esteem for humanity" title=""></a></p>

<p>What is <em>wrong</em> with people, amirite?</p>

<p>I humbly submit that this is asking the wrong question. </p>

<p><em>What is wrong with us?</em></p>

<p>I agree with Anil Dash. If your website is full of assholes, <a href="http://dashes.com/anil/2011/07/if-your-websites-full-of-assholes-its-your-fault.html">it's your fault</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As it turns out, we have a way to prevent gangs of humans from acting like savage packs of animals. In fact, we've developed entire disciplines based around this goal over thousands of years. We just ignore most of the lessons that have been learned when we create our communities online. But, by simply learning from disciplines like urban planning, zoning regulations, crowd control, effective and humane policing, and the simple practices it takes to stage an effective public event, we can come up with a set of principles to prevent the overwhelming majority of the worst behaviors on the Internet.</p>
  
  <p>If you run a website, you need to follow these steps. if you don't, you're making the web, and the world, a worse place. And it's your fault. Put another way, take some goddamn responsibility for what you unleash on the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, <strong>if you are unwilling to moderate your online community, you don't deserve to have an online community.</strong> There's no end of websites recreating the glorious "no stupid rules" libertarian paradise documented in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_of_the_Flies">Lord of the Flies</a> in their comment sections, from scratch, each and every day. This ends exactly as you would expect it to.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2014/Mar/libertarian_lifeguard.jpg" alt="Libertarians make bad lifeguards"></p>

<p>However, demanding that every online community, every comment section, have active moderation is a tough sell:</p>

<ul>
<li>Skilled moderators are difficult to find. A bad moderator is often <em>worse</em> than no moderator.</li>
<li>Do you have the budget to pay full time moderators?</li>
<li>Are your moderators around 24/7?</li>
<li>If you have a single moderator making unilateral decisions, who appeals their decisions? If you have multiple moderators, how do they resolve disagreements?</li>
<li>What happens when your moderators inevitably burn out or move on?</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the reasons I <a href="http://www.discourse.org/about/">launched the Discourse project</a> was due to the utter lack of understanding of how you build software to help online discussion communities moderate themselves. Their survival depends on it.</p>

<p>What I learned building Stack Overflow, more than anything else, is this: <strong>the only form of moderation that scales with the community is the community itself.</strong> We became quite skilled at building <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/01/trilogy-2011-elections-begin/">systems</a> for self governance of online communities, and one of the things I'm proudest of is that &ndash; if we did our jobs well &ndash; decades from now <a href="http://www.stackexchange.com/">Stack Exchange</a> will still be a network of viable, functioning, entirely self-governing communities.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/no-matter-what-they-tell-you-its-a-people-problem/">It's always a people problem</a>. This is absolutely true. But it's also true that software can <em>profoundly</em> affect people's behavior, and provide tools for <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/training-your-users/">encouraging positive behaviors</a> while modifying and mitigating negative behaviors. All that stuff Anil Dash described as <a href="http://dashes.com/anil/2011/07/if-your-websites-full-of-assholes-its-your-fault.html">your responsibility?</a> Discourse handles it automatically, even if the owner installs and then walks away forever.</p>

<p>These are <a href="http://blog.discourse.org/2013/03/the-universal-rules-of-civilized-discourse/">the principles of civilized discourse</a> that Discourse is founded on, that our discussion software is designed around. Civilization begins with software that actively works to help you create safe environments for having reasonable conversations with other human beings. On the <em>Internet</em>, even!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.discourse.org/"><img src="http://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2014/Mar/logo_smaller.png" alt="discourse" title=""></a></p>

<p>This is all a very long winded way of saying that effective immediately, <strong>Coding Horror is using <a href="http://www.discourse.org/">Discourse</a> to power its discussions.</strong></p>

<p>You may have questions, so I will attempt to answer them:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>This blog is <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/10-years-of-coding-horror/">now hosted on Ghost</a>, which doesn't natively support comments. All previous TypePad comments were converted into Discourse. To the best of our ability, nothing was lost.</p></li>
<li><p>Discourse is still beta, but <a href="http://blog.discourse.org/2014/01/the-road-to-discourse-1-0-2/">late beta</a>. Expect changes and improvements as we make our way to 1.0.</p></li>
<li><p>Discourse is a <em>companion</em> area to this blog, a clubhouse for the community. You can visit there directly at <a href="http://discourse.codinghorror.com/">discourse.codinghorror.com</a></p></li>
<li><p>Every new blog post here results in a corresponding topic being automatically created in the Discourse discussion area.</p></li>
<li><p>I do not, and will not, offer in-page commenting here. If you want to reply with a comment, you go <a href="http://blog.discourse.org/2013/05/your-online-clubhouse/">next door to the community clubhouse</a>. There's a fairly strong, but permeable, membrane between the editorial area <em>here</em> and the community area <em>there</em>. This is intentional.</p></li>
<li><p>At the bottom of each blog entry here you will find read only versions of all replies to the Discourse topic associated with this blog entry. I might eventually switch that to a "best of" algorithm so readers see the best comments without having to wade through dozens or hundreds of replies.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If you like what you see, Discourse is <a href="http://github.com/discourse/discourse">100% free open source software</a>, so you can easily <a href="http://eviltrout.com/2014/01/22/embedding-discourse.html">set up the same system</a> for your own blog. We even have a <a href="https://github.com/discourse/wp-discourse">WordPress plugin</a> to assist.</p>

<p>Now who's <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-ultimate-dogfooding-story/">ready for some dogfooding?</a></p>

<a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-trap-you-set-for-yourself/">The Trap You Set For Yourself</a>
</h4>
<h5 class="itemposttime">
<span>Posted:</span>Mon, 17 Mar 2014 07:58:34 GMT</h5>
<div class="itemcontent" name="decodeable"><p>The Dan Ariely books <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0061854549/?tag=codihorr-20">Predictably Irrational</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JBHVZY?tag=codihorr-20">The Upside of Irrationality</a> profoundly influenced the way I design my massively multiplayer <a href="http://www.discourse.org/">typing</a> <a href="http://www.stackexchange.com/">games</a>. These books offer science in the small about human behavior, and stark insights into user behavior &mdash; and by that I mean our <em>own</em> behavior.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Long-Goodbye-Raymond-Chandler/dp/0394757688?tag=codihorr-20"><img src="http://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2014/Mar/the_long_goodbye.png" alt="The Long Goodbye" title=""></a></p>

<p>All detectives are by definition students of human nature. As the famous fictional detective Philip Marlowe is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Long-Goodbye-Raymond-Chandler/dp/0394757688?tag=codihorr-20">fond of noting</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is no trap so deadly as the trap you set for yourself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We're born pretty darn great at lying to ourselves, and we get progressively better and better at it the older we become. In software development terms, <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/every-user-lies/">every user lies</a>.</p>

<p>We become experts at lying to ourselves to avoid being functionally crippled on a daily basis by the ongoing fears that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>your work does not matter.</p></li>
<li><p>your life does not matter.</p></li>
<li><p>nobody cares about you.</p></li>
<li><p>you aren't good enough.</p></li>
<li><p>you aren't smart enough.</p></li>
<li><p>gosh darn it, <em>people don't like you.</em></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, lying to yourself is part of the human condition. Otherwise nobody would be able to get out of bed in the morning.</p>

<p>However, if you have daily internal struggles with self doubt and indecision, you are almost certainly not going to achieve your mission, whatever it may be. I have found that, <strong>to a disturbing degree in this world, you have to <em>believe your own hype to succeed</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this is something that <a href="http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2010/01/a-rant-about-women/">men are better than women at</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And it looks to me like women in general, and the women whose educations I am responsible for in particular, are often lousy at those kinds of behaviors, even when the situation calls for it. <strong>They aren’t just bad at behaving like arrogant self-aggrandizing jerks. They are bad at behaving like self-promoting narcissists, anti-social obsessives, or pompous blowhards, even a little bit, even temporarily, even when it would be in their best interests to do so.</strong> Whatever bad things you can say about those behaviors, you can’t say they are underrepresented among people who have changed the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So how exactly do you suppress your self doubt without eventually becoming an overbearing, axe-grinding &hellip; male &hellip; zealot? Or, even worse, a character from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wolf-Wall-Street-Blu-ray-Digital/dp/B00H9KKKAY?tag=codihorr-20">The Wolf of Wall Street</a>?</p>

<p>One of the odder asides in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JBHVZY?tag=codihorr-20">The Upside of Irrationality</a> is about the 1995 movie First Knight. Which is quite frankly <em>terrible</em>. Don't see it. I'm not even going to link to it. But you should watch the first few minutes of this particular swordfight scene that Ariely highlights:</p>

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/3fM0UOoHyCI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Mark</strong>: How did you do that? How did he <em>do that?</em> Was that a trick?</p>
  
  <p><strong>Lancelot</strong>: No. No trick. It's the way I fight.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Mark</strong>: Could I do it? Tell me. I can learn.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Lancelot</strong>: You have to study your opponent, how he moves, so you know what he's going to do before he does it.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Mark</strong>: I can do that.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Lancelot</strong>: You have to know that one moment in one fight, when you win or lose. And you have to know how to wait for it.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Mark</strong>: I can do that.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Lancelot</strong>: And you have to not care whether you live or die.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Mark</strong>: (stunned silence)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The way Lancelot motivates himself to get past self-doubt in combat is <em>not to care whether he lives or dies</em>.</p>

<p>I don't mean this in the glib way of saying you should stop caring what anyone else thinks. Obviously we care what other people think. Not caring what other people think of us and what we do is the path of the narcissist, the sociopath, and the insane. That's giving up.</p>

<p>As Ariely says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lancelot fights better than anyone else because he found a way to bring the stress of the situation to zero. If he doesn’t care whether he lives or dies, nothing rides on his performance. He doesn’t worry about living past the end of the fight, so nothing clouds his mind and affects his abilities — he is pure concentration and skill.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The opinions of other people matter, but they are the traps we set for ourselves. To get past our collective prison of self doubt &ndash; <em>am I doing the right thing? Do I even know what the right thing is any more?</em> &ndash; concentrate on the daily routine of doing what <em>you</em> enjoy, what <em>you</em> believe in, what <em>you</em> find intrinsically satisfying.</p>

<p>This is what your life is: whatever it is you get up to do every single day. Stop stressing out about the long term stuff and focus on improving <em>that</em>, and you too might eventually find <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/how-to-stop-sucking-and-be-awesome-instead/">you don't want to live forever</a>.</p>

</h4>
<h5 class="itemposttime">
<span>Posted:</span>Fri, 28 Feb 2014 09:01:29 GMT</h5>
<div class="itemcontent" name="decodeable"><p>In 2007, I was offered $120,000 to buy this blog outright.</p>

<p>I was sorely tempted, because that's a lot of money. I had to think about it for a week. Ultimately I decided that my blog was an integral part of who I was, and who I eventually might become. How can you sell <em>yourself</em>, even for $120k?</p>

<p>I sometimes imagine how different my life would have been if I had taken that offer. Would Stack Overflow exist? Would Discourse? It's easy to look back now and say I made the right decision, but it was <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/choosing-your-own-adventure/">far less clear at the time</a>.</p>

<p>One of my philosophies is to <strong>always pick the choice that scares you a little</strong>. The status quo, the path of least resistance, the everyday routine &mdash; that stuff is easy. Anyone can do that. But the right decisions, the decisions that challenge you, the ones that push you to evolve and grow and learn, are always a little scary.</p>

<p>I'm thinking about all this because this month marks the <strong>10 year anniversary of Coding Horror</strong>. I am officially old school. I've been blogging for a full decade now. Just after the "wardrobe malfunction" Janet Jackson had on stage at Super Bowl XXXVIII in February 2004, I began with <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/recommended-reading-for-developers/">a reading list</a> and a new year's resolution to write one blog entry every weekday. I was even able to keep that pace up for a few years!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITy6DZ1adtA"><img src="http://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2014/Feb/janet_jackson_2004_clothing_malfunction.jpg" alt="Janet Jackson clothing malfunction" title=""></a></p>

<p>The ten year mark is a time for change. As of today, I'm pleased to announce that Coding Horror is now proudly hosted on <a href="https://ghost.org/">the Ghost blog platform</a>. I've been a blog minimalist from the start, and finding a truly open source platform which reflects that minimalism and focus is incredibly refreshing. Along with the new design, you may also notice that comments are no longer present. Don't worry. <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/welcome-back-comments/">I love comments</a>. They'll all be back. This is only a temporary state, as there's <a href="http://eviltrout.com/2014/01/22/embedding-discourse.html">another notable open source project</a> I want to begin supporting here.</p>

<p>It is odd to meet developers that tell me they "grew up" with Coding Horror. But I guess that's what happens when you <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/how-to-achieve-ultimate-blog-success-in-one-easy-step/">keep at something for long enough</a>, given a modest amount of talent and sufficient resolve. You become recognized. Maybe even influential. Now, after 10 years, <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/overnight-success-it-takes-years/">I am finally an overnight success</a>. And: old.</p>

<p>So, yeah, it's fair to say that <strong>blogging quite literally changed my life</strong>. But I also found that as the audience grew, I felt more pressure to write deeply about topics that are truly worthy of everyone's time, <em>your</em> time, rather than frittering it away on talking head opinions on this week's news. So I wrote less. And when things got extra busy at Stack Exchange, and now at Discourse, I didn't write at all.</p>

<p>I used to tell people who asked me for advice about blogging that if they couldn't think about one interesting thing to write about every week, they weren't trying hard enough. The world is full of so many amazing things and incredible people. As Albert Einstein once said, there are two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.comixology.com/Watchmen/comics-collection/403"><img src="http://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2014/Mar/watchmen_page_27.jpg" alt="Watchmen page" title=""></a></p>

<p>I wasn't trying hard enough. I had forgotten.  I can't fully process all the things that are happening to me until I write about them. I have to be able to tell the story to understand it myself. <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/on-the-meaning-of-coding-horror/">My happiness only becomes real when I share it with all of you</a>.</p>

<p>This is the philosophy that <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/stack-overflow-none-of-us-is-as-dumb-as-all-of-us/">underlies Stack Overflow</a>. This is the philosophy that <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/civilized-discourse-construction-kit/">underlies Discourse</a>. These are all projects based on large scale, communal shared happiness. Love of learning. Love of teamwork. Love of community. </p>

<p>Love.</p>

<p>For the next decade of Coding Horror, I resolve to remember how miraculous that is.</p>
