Parliament
==========

ParliamentProject is an experimentation project about Information Extraction from the Greek government parliament 
transcripts.
It uses a Java application together with GATE (http://gate.ac.uk) in order to extract speeches, parliamentary reports, questions and various other information and present them in a readable format for viewing or data analysis. It is still a work in progress and updated regularly.
Further information exists in the ParliamentProjectReport.pdf
